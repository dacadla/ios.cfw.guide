## Required Reading

In many circumstances, updating to a newer version of iOS can make it harder to jailbreak or introduce more issues while in a jailbroken state.

Luckily, iOS 15.6's *first release candidate* is still signed, meaning you can restore to it from any other iOS version with the help of iTunes or Finder.

::: warning

Make sure you disable `Find My` or you'll need to enter Recovery or DFU before restoring your device.
